# Memory-Game
## UX

### Project Goals
This project aims to build an interactive front-end website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I have decided to build a Memory Game that allows users to enjoy a fun and challenging pattern-matching experience. I have used the knowledge I've learned in the course to date, as well as good user experience principles, to create a responsive, well-designed, and functional game.

My web page consists of:  
- A landing page that introduces the game, explains the rules, and includes a "Restart Game" button.  
- The game board, which displays a grid of cards that the player can click to flip and match.  
- Feedback messages that indicate matches, mismatches, and game completion.  
- A restart button that allows the user to play again at any time.  
- A responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
